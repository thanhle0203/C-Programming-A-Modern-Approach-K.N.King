   C Programming: A Modern Approach, Second Edition
   Chapter 4, Programming Project 4
   Write a program tha reads an integer entered by the user and
   displays it in octal (base 8):
       Enter a number between 0 and 32767: 1953
       In octal, your number is: 03641
   The output should be displayed using five digits, even if fewer
   digits are sufficient. Hint: To convert the number to octal, first
   divide it by 8; the remainder is the last digit of the octal number
   (1, in this case). Then divide the original number by 8 and repeat
   the process to arrive at the next-to-last digit. (printf is capable
   of displaying numbers in base 8, as we'll see in Chapter 7, so there's
   actually an easier way to write this program.)
   
My project:
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void)
{
    int input, x1, x2, x5, x6, x7;
    
    printf("\nEnter a number between 0 and 32767: ");
    scanf("%d", &input);
    
    x1 = input % 8; /*Get the last digit number*/
    input = input /8;
    
    x2 = input % 8; /*Get the second last digit number*/
    input = input / 8;
    
    x5 = input % 8; /*Get the third last digit number*/
    x6 = input /8; /*Get the second last digit number*/
    
    x7 = (input-x5)% 8; /*Get the firs digit number*/
    printf("In octal, your number is: %d%d%d%d%d\n\n", x7, x6, x5, x2, x1);
    
    return 0;
}
